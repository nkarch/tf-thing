# Transformers Thing

This is an attempt to build a minimal "Social Network" interface built primarily with Vite's React template and Redux Toolkit.

Install dependencies:
`npm install`

Run local dev environment:
`npm run dev`

## What actually is this?

An attempt to further improve my proficiency with React and Redux Toolkit. I'll do this by making a simple "social network" interface. I like Transformers so I'm going to make it Transformers themed, fetching characters' profile data and posts from (at least temporarily) static JSON.

The interface will visually start off very bare bones. I'm not sure how far I want to take that.

_Don't be mad._
